Documentaries, and useful web tech/information for kids, students, and even teachers!
Do not let teachers use this, its mainly meant for kids and students, and if a teacher used it the teacher/you wouldn't like it.
Trust my information and let the kids/students of you school use this, it is a very good teaching method, and approved by MANY schools and countries.
Now if you have read this far teachers, stop reading and give this website/software to you kids/students to use, and learn many many great things and information about the world; and if a student has read this far scroll all the way down past the information to see the true ideals about this website...






























































































This website IS NOT for information learning, it is disguised as a software/website to help you learn so it will not be blocked, it secretly is a website to play games and have fun on, if you go to Documentaries and go to the last page, there will be a secret "GAMES" button that teachers don't see or dismiss, if you click on it you will be brong to a URL Proxy but just think of it as an Incognito browser. Use it as much as your heart wants, afterall if your sneaky enough you can use it forever, and also under the URL Proxy and the bottom is a Games button and right next to it is a tab cloaker, the games button only has 10-50 games but in the future will have over 100+ games. So enjoy and don't let anything let you down in life.
